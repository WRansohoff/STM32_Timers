  * @brief   CMSIS Cortex-M0 Device Peripheral Access Layer System Source File.
  *
  * 1. This file provides two functions and one global variable to be called from
  *    user application:
  *      - SystemInit(): This function is called at startup just after reset and 
  *                      before branch to main program. This call is made inside
  *                      the "startup_stm32f0xx.s" file.
  *
  *      - SystemCoreClock variable: Contains the core clock (HCLK), it can be used
  *                                  by the user application to setup the SysTick
  *                                  timer or configure other parameters.
  *
  *      - SystemCoreClockUpdate(): Updates the variable SystemCoreClock and must
  *                                 be called whenever the core clock is changed
  *                                 during program execution.
  *
  * 2. After each device reset the HSI (8 MHz) is used as system clock source.
  *    Then SystemInit() function is called, in "startup_stm32f0xx.s" file, to
  *    configure the system clock before to branch to main program.
  *
  * 3. This file configures the system clock as follows:
